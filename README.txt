## Project Objective

The objective of the project is to create an UNO Flip card game. Uno Flip is a variation of the classic Uno card game, and we aim to provide an interactive and user-friendly experience for players.

## Project Milestones

### Milestone 1 (Completed)

In this first milestone, we successfully developed a playable text-based version of the UNO card game. Players can interact with the game through the console using keyboard input. This milestone includes the following features:

- Player Range: The ability to play the UNO game with 2 - 4 players. 
- Card Visibility: The ability to display the cards in the current player's hand.
- Official Notation: The cards are all labeled using official UNO card notation as specified on the wikipedia page. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_Flip!)
- Draw Method: The ability to draw a card if the player has no playable cards in their hand. 
- Special Card Actions: 
	- Reverse Card: Reverses the order of playing
	- Skip Card: Skips the turn of the player who is meant to play next. 
	- Wild Card: Allows a player to choose the current colour of the playing cards.
	- Wild Draw Two Card: Allows a player to choose the current colour of the playing cards, and gives the player playing next two more cards. 
- Card State Observation: Display the resultant state of the cards in a text format. 
- Card Placement Validation: Ensures that the placement of the cards is valid based on the rules of the UNO Flip game. 
- Scoring: The ability to add and update the scores of each player currently playing. 
- Testing: The program has been tested using JUnit tests, to ensure a functional program.
